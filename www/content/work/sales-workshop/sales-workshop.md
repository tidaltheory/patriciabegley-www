## Bridging the Gap

As Principal of Product Design, I've observed a recurring challenge: our Sales team faces difficulties in fully grasping and conveying the depth of our digital app development and innovation capabilities. This sometimes results in missed opportunities, misaligned client expectations, and challenges in showcasing the true value of our expertise. To strengthen our client relationships and achieve better results, it's clear that bridging this knowledge gap is essential.

### Approach

Recognizing the need for change, I initiated an internal project to better align our UX, app development, and innovation teams with Sales. My goal was to ensure they had the knowledge and tools to confidently represent our skills in client conversations. Here’s how I approached it:

**Conducting Stakeholder Interviews** - Engaging both the Sales and Digital App & Innovation teams to understand pain points, misconceptions, and key knowledge gaps.

**Developing a Knowledge-Sharing Framework** – Creating a structured series of workshops and resources to educate the Sales team on product design principles, digital app development processes, and innovation trends.

**Creating a Sales Enablement Toolkit** – Designing easy-to-understand reference materials, including visual guides, terminology glossaries, and client-facing narratives that aligned with business value.

**Establishing Ongoing Collaboration** – Encouraging continuous dialogue between the team and Sales through periodic check-ins and feedback loops to refine messaging and knowledge.

### Outcome

**Enhanced Sales Effectiveness** – Sales representatives gained confidence in communicating digital innovation capabilities, leading to more compelling client pitches.

**Stronger Cross-Team Collaboration** – Improved alignment between Digital App & Innovation and Sales fostered a more cohesive internal culture.

**Increased Client Engagement** – More accurate and persuasive storytelling improved client understanding and trust, resulting in higher conversion rates.

**Sustained Learning & Adaptability** – The introduction of ongoing knowledge-sharing practices ensured the Sales team stayed informed on evolving digital trends.

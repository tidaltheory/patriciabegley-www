## Helping Career Growth

Connecting potential applicants with personal advisors through their external website, this career growth non-profit organization prepares women for a career in trades and transportation with free employment and skills training.

However, many applicants abandoned the intake process before connecting with an advisor and for those who do connect, the communication process was challenging due to the use of various IT systems with inconsistent interfaces and terminology.

### Approach

Working alongside a junior designer, together we conducted heuristic reviews of the existing workflow users engage when initially applying. As we were unable to work with users directly, we gathered insight via interviews with advisors and began mapping out workflows.

### Outcome

The client visualized the overall journey and embraced the future state ideology, experiencing how the recommendations could simplify internal processes and enhance customer service. The team identified opportunities for incremental changes, paving the way for a more cost-effective implementation project in the future.

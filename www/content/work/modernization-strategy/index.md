## Guiding a Client’s LOS Modernization Strategy

This project was particularly challenging because our client wanted diverse perspectives on the future direction of their Loan Origination System (LOS). Rather than just executing a predefined plan, they were looking for strategic guidance—insights that would help shape their modernization efforts.
Given our long-standing relationship with this client, we already had deep familiarity with their existing framework and product portfolio. However, before recommending a path forward, we needed to explore not just their current system’s limitations but also the potential benefits of enhancements or even an out-of-the-box solution.

### Approach

To ensure we delivered a well-rounded strategy, I organized internal working sessions with key stakeholders across various teams, including:

- **Architects** – To assess technical feasibility and integration challenges
- **Project Managers** – To evaluate business impact and implementation considerations
- **Developers** – To explore development efficiencies and limitations
- **Designers** – To consider user experience and usability improvements
- **Sales Team** – To understand market positioning and client demand

Bringing together this diverse group allowed us to explore multiple perspectives and ensure we weren’t just solving the problem from a technical standpoint but also considering business goals and user needs.

As I facilitated these discussions, we conducted competitive research, explored industry best practices, and analyzed the client’s existing pain points. This helped us define:

- The gaps in their current LOS
- The potential advantages of modernization
- Whether an off-the-shelf solution could meet their needs better than a custom-built approach

### Design system

As we established a rhythm with our research, we shifted our focus to developing a design system. This system ensures consistency and efficiency by providing standardized guidelines and reusable components across different parts of the product. Alongside two other product designers, we audited and catalogued the entire product, presenting our findings internally and to leadership. This growing system helps teams maintain a cohesive user experience and accelerates the design and development process.

### Outcome

By the end of our discovery process, we had a clear, research-driven roadmap tailored to the client’s needs. Our insights gave them a structured way to evaluate their modernization options, aligning their business objectives, technical capabilities, and market demands.

Most importantly, we didn’t just provide recommendations—we empowered them with the knowledge and strategic perspective to make confident, informed decisions about their LOS direction.
